This code aims to build a network system for one dimensional pulsuating heat pipe.

Roght now the dynamics are constructed, using the reference of "Analysis of liquidâ€“vapor pulsating flow in a
U-shaped miniature tube" from Zhang et.al (2002)

Future work 1 is to add the heat transfer part of the liquid slug.
Future work 2 is to use more fancy(?) phase change model to replace the simple model here.
Future work 3 is to use EnKF!!!
